<p>Kenny and I have been playing about with the schemes repo; I've been trying to glue sheaves together on subspaces. I realise when doing this work that there are big design decisions that need to be made. A sheaf in maths is just some assignment of a type to each open subset of a topological space, modulo a bit of extra structure and some axioms. I'd been working with <code>opens X</code> but now I'm working with sheaves on open subsets of X I am forever wrestling with <code>opens U</code> with <code>U : opens X</code> and having to dig through subtypes of subtypes etc. Sure I could write a bunch of API for <code>opens U</code>. On the other hand I could just try and avoid subtypes completely -- this was <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span> 's suggestion -- and even go so far as to define a sheaf on an open subspace of a topological space just to be pair (U,F) where U is open, F is a sheaf on all of X, and the values of F are irrelevant if we evaluate on a set that isn't an open subset of U. This seems to be leading to some sort of "how to do this sort of thing optimally in dependent type theory" conversation and it reminds me a lot of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110172">@Assia Mahboubi</span> using subgroups instead of groups in Coq (the rooster and the butterfly) and so on. Doing it like this, the restriction of F to an open subspace is very very easy indeed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my plan has always been to use <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> 's category theory work to do sheaves, as this is the language which is used in practice by mathematicians. However in some sense I now feel that this would drift even further from the "very easy" approach and force me to write even more API. I do not object to writing more API. But I'm just confused about the best approach to take. Scott's approach seems to be far closer to what a mathematician would do, and Kenny's to what a computer scientist would do. I don't know which one I want to be though, in this context. I somehow get the feeling that it matters though.</p>

<p>It feels a bit like this weird idea of defining a subset to be compact instead of defining what it means for a top space to be compact.</p>

<p>I don't know how feasible this is in this case but maybe you can pick an application which needs gluing of sheaves--fiber products maybe--and imagine (if not actually carry out) the construction using the interface you intend to provide</p>

<p>Well I guess gluing schemes is a bit more work than gluing sheaves</p>

<p>Couldn't you identify a sheaf on U with either its extension by zero or push-forward to X? They both make a lot of mathematical sense , and they are fully faithful functors so that you don't lose any information.</p>

<p>Indeed! But in this game people might equally want to just say "what is going on outside U is junk". The extension by zero would be hard to work with in Lean -- the definition would then be "if V is a subset of U then the correct thing, else 0", and you would forever be splitting ifs. The pushforward is easier because its value on V is the correct value on V intersect U, so you are just having to invoke the fact that the intersection of two opens is open occasionally, which sounds nicer. What I am frustrated about is that both of them seem to be slightly artificial workarounds for the thing I want to have, which is the sheaf on U and nothing more. My question is whether I should bite the bullet and work with the thing that seems right to me or make these artificial extensions. Even with the extensions one has to choose whether to prove that the sheaf axiom holds for the extension or just check it on U.</p>
<p>Hmm. Here's another issue. What I want to be easy is this: given X a top space, and F a sheaf on U (an open subset of X) and V an open subset of U, I want the restriction of F to V. With my suggestion ("junk outside U") I can literally use F again, With either the pushforward (they call it <code>map</code> here) or extension by zero one would have to change F. What I have no real feeling about is whether the convenience of being able to recycle F is worth anything, or whether I should just bite the bullet, write some code which does what I want "properly" (i.e. a sheaf on U is just a function on the open subsets of U and hang the other open subsets of X) and then just figure out the API I need. I might need a lot of API. But this is not a mathematical issue, it is a tedious implementation issue.</p>
