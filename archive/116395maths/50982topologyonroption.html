<p>A good way to set up this question of the topology on <code>roption X</code> is to ask what universal property it should have/what functor it should represent. We already that an arbitrary function <code>f : X -&gt; roption Y</code> corresponds to a <code>S : set X</code> and a function <code>g : S -&gt; Y</code>. Then we could choose one of several conditions for <code>f</code> to be continuous, for example:<br>
(a) <code>f</code> is continuous iff <code>g</code> is continuous;<br>
(b) <code>f</code> is continuous iff <code>s</code> is open and <code>g</code> is continuous;<br>
((c) <code>f</code> is continuous iff <code>s</code> is closed and <code>g</code> is continuous; I don't think this is at all useful for the application of defining manifolds, but the point is the list of options is open-ended...)<br>
For each of these options, there is at most one topology on <code>roption Y</code> making it hold (by the Yoneda lemma). Then we have a little exercise to determine whether the topology really exists and if so what it looks like.<br>
The point is that we're really going to use the fact (a)/(b) to work with this topology anyways--the exact construction of the topology is less important.</p>

<p>If <code>Y</code> is a point, then a function <code>X -&gt; roption Y</code> corresponds to just a subset <code>S</code> of <code>X</code> and in this case I happen to know that the answers are<br>
(a) the indiscrete topology (<code>\bot</code>) on <code>roption Y</code>,<br>
(b) the Sierpinski topology on <code>roption Y</code> ~ <code>Prop</code>,<br>
((c) the Sierpinski topology on <code>roption Y</code> ~ <code>Prop</code> but with the roles of the points reversed via <code>not</code>).<br>
So I guess that there are probably solutions for general <code>Y</code> as well.</p>
