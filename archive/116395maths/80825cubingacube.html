<p>Larry Paulson issued the following challenge in his Big Proof talk: formalise a proof that it is impossible to divide a cube up into n&gt;1 smaller cubes all of different sizes, in a theorem prover of your choice. Here's an example of an informal proof: <a href="http://www.alaricstephen.com/main-featured/2017/9/28/cubing-a-cube-proof" target="_blank" title="http://www.alaricstephen.com/main-featured/2017/9/28/cubing-a-cube-proof">http://www.alaricstephen.com/main-featured/2017/9/28/cubing-a-cube-proof</a> . I think it's OK to assume that all the cubes are oriented in the obvious way, i.e. no weird diagonal cubes; what I'm saying is that the problem can be formalised as a statement in discrete mathematics rather than one about the real numbers.</p>

<p>why this particular problem though?</p>

<p>I'm just reporting on his talk. It's finished now but I can ask him. I think I know the answer though. He formalised the proof that you can't cover an 8x8 chessboard with two opposite corners removed, with dominoes, and was just issuing a challenge of a similar nature which is harder.</p>

<p>isn't this related to dehn invariants or some such?</p>
