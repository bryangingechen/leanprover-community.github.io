<p>Dear Lean people,<br>
I have the three newbie questions.</p>
<p>1. Generally, can Lean be used as a provable programming language?<br>
So that to implement an efficient algorithm and also prove its correctness, and then also to run the obtained code.</p>
<p>2. Concretely: consider implementing fraction arithmetic over an arbitrary GCD Domain R. Find sum of fractions by doing + and * in R, by computing gcd, and cancelling by it (in various places of the method). And provide a proof for that this +'  and *' on Q = (Fraction R ) make Q a field.<br>
a) Is this possible to program in Lean and to run as a more or less efficient program?<br>
b) Is this already in some library for Lean ?<br>
I see "localization.lean" somewhere in mathlib, this is a generalization for Fraction field. But I do not find there using GCD, any matter of algorithms. Also I do not see there any comments.</p>
<p>3) The mathlib materials are difficult to understand, they just show the code. But there are needed comments in a humanly language in the first place, a reference to a textbook, to a paper (a similar problem I find in Coq).</p>
<p>Please, advise,</p>

<p>there are no "efficient" algorithms yet. they run kind of slowly.</p>

<p>I agree about comments in mathlib. Which files are you interested in in particular?</p>

<p>I think we have a merge sort (of the kind that uses linear additional space)--that's about it</p>
