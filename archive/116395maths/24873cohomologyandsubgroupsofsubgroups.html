<p>Cocycles are subgroups of cochains; coboundaries are subgroups of cocycles. Cohomology groups are cocycles over coboundaries. At least, that's how it works in group cohomology, and maybe in topology too.</p>
<p>I guess the cocycles will have to end up being a type at some point, because many arguments involve chasing cocycles and then proving that everything descends...sorry...lifts...to cohomology classes. (That still leaves a bad taste in my mouth). But the coboundaries are going to end up being a subtype of a subtype, which is kind of silly. In general we'll have a group <code>G</code> and then <code>Z B : set G</code> with <code>B \subseteq Z</code>, but will end up using the subtype corresponding to <code>B</code> and then we'll have to make the subtype of <code>B</code> corresponding to <code>Z</code>. Is this a situation where I should just try something and see if it works? Have we already run into this issue <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> ? Am I fussing over nothing? I have a student working on group cohomology and this is about to hit us.</p>

<p>In the Lean 2 HoTT library I've done homology (in this case of modules over a ring - obviously at some point we want to do it generally in an abelian category): <a href="https://github.com/cmu-phil/Spectral/blob/master/algebra/submodule.hlean#L376" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cmu-phil/Spectral/blob/master/algebra/submodule.hlean#L376">https://github.com/cmu-phil/Spectral/blob/master/algebra/submodule.hlean#L376</a><br>
(note: <code>property</code> means <code>set</code>)</p>
<p>You will indeed need lemma's/constructions, like if <code>Z</code> and <code>B</code> are both subgroups of <code>G</code> and <code>B \subseteq Z</code> then <code>B</code> is a subgroup of <code>Z</code>. Of course, the last <code>B</code> is not actually <code>B</code> but something like <code>(subtype.val \-1' B : set Z)</code>. But everything works fine.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span>  might tell you a different story, which is also worth considering. The idea is that if you do a lot of group theory in a <em>single</em> group <code>G</code>, you should be really doing subgroup theory. That means that for every definition and lemma, when a mathematician would write "Group", you would write "subgroup of <code>G</code>". And then you try to reason as much as you can using sets (and subsets) instead of subtypes. Jeremy can probably tell this story better.</p>

<p>I think this always the same story, explained in <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00825074v1/document" target="_blank" title="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00825074v1/document">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00825074v1/document</a> that was already quoted countless times on this chat</p>

<p>Can we do most of the subgroup theory using injective group homs instead? Sounds a bit like the localisation issue.</p>

<p>If you want to do homological algebra in an arbitrary abelian category then you are forced to do what Chris suggests anyways</p>
