<p>Here's a message I just posted to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/homotopytypetheory" target="_blank" title="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/homotopytypetheory">homotopy type theory google group forum</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi from a Lean user.</p>
<p>As many people here will know, Tom Hales' formal abstracts project <a href="https://formalabstracts.github.io/" target="_blank" title="https://formalabstracts.github.io/">https://formalabstracts.github.io/</a> wants to formalise many of the statements of modern pure mathematics in Lean. One could ask more generally about a project of formalising many of the statements of modern pure mathematics in an arbitrary system, such as HoTT. I know enough about the formalisation process to know that whatever system one chooses, there will be pain points, because some mathematical ideas fit more readily into some foundational systems than others.</p>
<p>I have seen enough of Lean to become convinced that the pain points would be surmountable in Lean. I have seen enough of Isabelle/HOL to become skeptical about the idea that it would be suitable for all of modern pure mathematics, although it is clearly suitable for some of it; however it seems that simple type theory struggles to handle things like tensor products of sheaves of modules on a scheme, because sheaves are dependent types and it seems that one cannot use Isabelle's typeclass system to handle the rings showing up in a sheaf of rings.</p>
<p>I have very little experience with HoTT. I have heard that the fact that "all constructions must be isomorphism-invariant" is both a blessing and a curse. However I would like to know more details. I am speaking at the Big Proof conference in Edinburgh this coming Wednesday on the pain points involved with formalising mathematical objects in dependent type theory and during the preparation of my talk I began to wonder what the analogous picture was with HoTT.</p>
<p>Everyone will have a different interpretation of "modern pure mathematics" so to fix our ideas, let me say that for the purposes of this discussion, "modern pure mathematics" means the statements of the theorems publishsed by the Annals of Mathematics over the last few years, so for example I am talking about formalising statements of theorems involving L-functions of abelian varieties over number fields, Hodge theory, cohomology of algebraic varieties, Hecke algebras of symmetric groups, Ricci flow and the like; one can see titles and more at <a href="http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2019/189-3" target="_blank" title="http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2019/189-3">http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2019/189-3</a> . Classical logic and the axiom of choice are absolutely essential -- I am only interested in the hard-core "classical mathematician" stance of the way mathematics works, and what it is.</p>
<p>If this is not the right forum for this question, I would be happily directed to somewhere more suitable. After spending 10 minutes failing to get onto ##hott on freenode ("you need to be identified with services") I decided it was easier just to ask here. If people want to chat directly I am usually around at <a href="" target="_blank" title="">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/</a> (registration required, full names are usually used, I'll start a HoTT thread in #mathematics).</p>

<p>Does anyone here have enough experience with HoTT to say anything? I've asked here questions like "what would the pain points be if one tried to formalise a scheme in HoTT?" and have got answers of the form "if you want to find out, you should go ahead and try". I'm not sure I have time to learn another system though. I have even dumber questions -- how would one define the trace of a linear map from a finite-dimensional vector space to itself? A mathematician would pick a basis, compute the trace of the corresponding matrix, and then note that it was independent of the choice. Is this problematic in HoTT?</p>

<p>I suppose it will depend on exactly how you define "finite-dimensional vector space". If it's defined as a vector space together with <code>trunc</code> of a basis, then the procedure for defining the trace of a map goes exactly how you describe.</p>

<p><code>trunc</code> is called the "propositional truncation" in HoTT although "proposition" there more closely corresponds to what Lean calls <code>subsingleton</code></p>

<p>In particular, this definition is constructive. However you would probably need the axiom of choice to prove that a quotient of a finite dimensional vector space is again finite dimensional.</p>

<p>Or maybe LEM is enough, but that's still an uncomputable axiom</p>

<p>I haven't actually used a HoTT-based theorem prover yet, only read the book. I do find it difficult to get a sense of how HoTT+choice would work in practice. I think this is a cultural phenomenon: there tends to be overlap between people interested in HoTT and people interested in constructive logic. (Consider that the same could be said about Coq, yet Lean is based on essentially the same underlying type theory and look where we are now.)</p>

<p>The HoTT people really embrace the D in DTT, and when you work like that the exact details of definitional equality matter a lot; but there is not a uniform conception of what it should be, so you end up with a bunch of incompatible axiomatizations</p>

Can I define its trace in HoTT?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean formalizing even relatively basic constructions like this one that (apparently) require choice.<br>
I'm pretty sure that this is possible in HoTT (plus choice). In either HoTT or Lean you must first prove that X is finite dimensional (has a finite basis); that part will go the same way. In HoTT you will also need to prove that the trace is independent of the choice of basis, which is not a bad thing.</p>

<p>In HoTT if I define what it means for a ring to be local, would I have to prove that a ring isomorphic to a local ring is local before I can even make the definition?</p>

<p>No, you'd define it the same way as in Lean</p>

<p>I think even stupid thing like this are isomorphism invariant in HoTT.</p>

<p>I think a first approximation to how choice works in HoTT, expressed in the language of Lean, is that one can no longer have <code>choice : nonempty X -&gt; X</code>, but one still has</p>
<ul>
<li><code>unique_choice : nonempty X -&gt; trunc X</code>, which means that you can extract a witness for an existential to construct something provided you can prove the result doesn't depend on the choice of witness, and</li>
<li><code>axiom_of_choice : (∀ x, ∃ y, r x y) -&gt; ∃ f, ∀ x, r x (f x)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>What's the difference between <code>nonempty</code> and <code>trunc</code> in HoTT?</p>

<p>There isn't one (at least in book HoTT) because HoTT has no notion of judgmentally being a proposition.</p>

<p>So unique choice is <code>id</code>?</p>

<p>So the result is that places where we would use an ∃ in Lean correspond to <code>|| ∃ ... ||</code> in HoTT</p>

<p>Right, so unique choice doesn't really correspond to anything in HoTT but I tried to give a translation into a Lean worldview.</p>

<p>Actually the HoTT book does have something it calls "unique choice", which is the statement that if P is a Prop (Lean: <code>subsingleton P</code>) then P is equivalent to ||P||.</p>
