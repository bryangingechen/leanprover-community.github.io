<p>In a separate thread I'm discussing the design of an affine space library. That's the context for this question. I need a mutually inductive definition of several types. I'm getting the following error message:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mutually inductive types compiled to invalid basic inductive type
nested exception message:
universe level of type_of(arg #4) of &#39;apoint._mut_.mk_0&#39; is too big for the corresponding inductive datatypeLean
</pre></div>


<p>The question is a basic one: how to debug this problem? It looks like I need to look at the compiled definition. Is that right? In that case, how? Or if it's obvious what's going wrong, I'd be happy simply to know the solution to this blocking problem, at least for right now.  I'm not posting the code at this point, hoping for insights without doing that, until the code's in better shape.</p>

<p>use <code>Type*</code> instead of manually calculating the universe</p>

<p>could you show the definition?</p>

<p>or at least the inductive itself, MWE not required</p>
