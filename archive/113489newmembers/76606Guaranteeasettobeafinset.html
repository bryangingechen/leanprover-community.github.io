<p>Hey guys, I want to ask about the cardinality of sets. I'm totally newbie to Lean so the questions might be trivial. Still, I need your help. </p>
<p>I encounter this error message: </p>
<p>"type mismatch, term<br>
  {l : list ℕ | isCanonnicalPartition n l}<br>
has type<br>
  set (list ℕ)<br>
but is expected to have type<br>
  finset (list ℕ)" </p>
<p>I interpret this as the LHS of my statement had been declared a finset, whereas Lean isnt sure the RHS is really a finset. </p>
<p>How could I tell Lean that a set constructed in a particular way is guaranteed to be a finset? Or is there any other way to fix this error message? </p>
<p>Thank you very much for your response!</p>
