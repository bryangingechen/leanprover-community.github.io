<p>I seem to have completed the exercise, but only through pattern recognition and some guesswork. Could someone explain to me why this works?</p>
<p><code>  variables (p q : Prop)
  example (h : ¬(p ↔ ¬p)) :=
    begin
      intros,
      apply iff.intro,
      exact h,
      apply false.elim,
    end
    --assume hw : p ↔ ¬ p,
    --show false, from h hw  </code></p>

<p>I wrote 2 proofs- one with tactics and one without. The one without seems like cheating, but shouldn't lean see that? Why did it work? Also when clicking around the commas in the tactics proof there seem to be special moments when lean creates multiple goals that are somehow identical (?) and then later they vanish. Specifically, this happens on the second line after <code> begin</code>. Some clarification on this would be great. I want to be able to appreciate odd proofs like this (if it even <em>is</em> a proof...).</p>
