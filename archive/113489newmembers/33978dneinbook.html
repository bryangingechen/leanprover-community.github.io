<p>Hello! In section 3.5 of the github book the second code snippet says:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>theorem dne {p : Prop} (h : ¬¬p) : p :=
or.elim (em p)
  (assume hp : p, hp)
  (assume hnp : ¬p, absurd hnp h)
</pre></div>


<p>If you hit "try it!" and delete the (assume hp:p, hp) line it complains. How is hp:p, hp used? Isn't it enough to just assume hnp and h?</p>

<p>The first line splits the proof up into two cases, the case when <code>p</code> is true, and the case when <code>¬p</code> is true. You have to prove both. It will therefore expect two proofs as arguments, one of <code>p -&gt; p</code>, and also a proof of <code>¬p -&gt; p</code>. The second line is a proof of <code>p -&gt; p</code>, and the final line is the proof that <code>¬p -&gt; p</code>.</p>
<p>You can only <code>assume hp : p</code> if you're trying to prove a goal of the form <code>p -&gt; something</code></p>

<p>it complains because or.elim requires you to provide two functions/proofs, one for the left side of the or, one for the right side of the or. <br>
say you want to prove a proposition p, and you're given a ∨ b. then you need to provide two proofs, a → p and b → p.<br>
in your example, you want to prove p, by eliminating the disjunction em p = p ∨ ¬p.<br>
one of these cases is trivial (the first one), and the second one requires you to use your assumption hnp.</p>
