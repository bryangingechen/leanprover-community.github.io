<p>One of the main use cases for abstract math is physics. Suppose I want to do physics formally using Lean. One of the mathematical structures I'd like to work with is that of the real Euclidean space. Can you help me understand how close or far we are from being able to represent real Euclidean spaces in Lean, including objects such as points and vectors, operations such as vector-vector and point-vector addition, and transformations such as rigid body motions and affine transformations more generally? (Beneath this question lies the fact that, for me at least, without many examples, it's hard to know what I can do with the bits and snippets I find out there, e.g., reals as Cauchy sequences, etc.)</p>

<p>Mario, Thanks. Do you have any guidance on how to gain an understanding of (1) what's already done---if only what files to look at, but better yet some applications that use them, or even better yet, papers about them, (2) what would need to be done to get to the point where we could model finite Euclidean spaces, particularly over the reals, even if only as a special case?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="124175">@Kevin Sullivan</span> Further tips: the search function on Github and in VScode can be really useful. If those fail, just ask about a specific concept here, and we'll be able to tell you if it's in the library. You will hit things that are missing quite soon. But it is hard to tell what they are without starting out on a Lean file.</p>

<p>Thank you, Kevin, Johan, Mario. I'm working through your suggestions. A question comes up. What is the conceptual difference between field and discrete_field? The latter is a term I perhaps should but don't know from my limited studies of algebra.</p>

<p>I think the rule is <code>discrete_field</code> is a maths field and we should all pretend <code>field</code> doesn't exist (and we'd change the name if it wasn't in core).</p>

<p>Ok, so I have started typing. The aim is to develop at least a formal sketch of a formalization of affine spaces. Here's how I started, and I immediately ran into a few questions, which I pose here.</p>
<p>You will recall that an affine space comprises a vector space V over a field K and a nonempty set, A, of points, with an addition operation, + : point -&gt; vector -&gt; point, satisfying a few axioms (e.g., \all p, p + 0 = p). My implementation strategy is to build on what's already in the libraries. So here's how I started.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>class affine_space
    (P : Type)                                                  -- points
    (K: Type) [discrete_field K]               -- scalars
    (G : Type) [add_comm_group G]    -- vectors
    (V : vector_space K G) :=                     -- K vector space over G
(add : P → G → P)
</pre></div>


<p>I initially typed "add : P  → V → P", but of course V isn't s type. So, question <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1">#1</a>: does "add : P → G → P" look right? I'd like to be sure that I start with a sound typeclass specification before building all the rest of it.  Question <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2">#2</a>: I've chosen to use "has-a" relations rather than "is-a", using object-oriented lexicon, by which I mean that I incorporate P, K, G, and V as field values rather than using "extends" to "inherit" these structures. The rational is that an affine space "has a" vector space but not "is a" vector space. Does this look right to those of you who design these kinds of libraries?</p>
<p>Thank you!<br>
Kevin</p>

<p>It would probably make sense to setup a general theory of torsors... and then define an affine space to be a torsor of a vector space.</p>

<p>You would be able to reuse the general setup for things like quantities (mass, length, &amp;c are torsors under <code>units real</code>). I'm far from being a (mathematical) physicist, so I have no idea if that would be useful.</p>

<p>Let's ignore for the moment the fact that you want to use additive notation.  Then the natural thing would be to start with the class <code>mul_action G X</code> from <code>src/group_theory/group_action.lean</code>, and extend it to give a class <code>principal_action</code> involving a "division" map <code>X  →  X →  G</code> such that <code>(y / x) • x = y</code>.  You might need some other axioms, or they might follow automatically, especially in the case where <code>G</code> is a group.  Then you could specialise to the case where <code>G</code> is the additive group of a vector space.</p>
<p>It's also possible to leave <code>G</code> out of the picture and axiomatize everything in terms of the subset of parallelograms in <code>X ^ 4</code>; then you recover <code>G</code> as a quotient of <code>X ^ 2</code>.  </p>
<p>Ideally we should have a class for additive actions that is magically connected to the class for multiplicative actions, so we don't have to prove essentially the same results twice.  We have similar things in some closely related contexts, but not this one.  But it would not be hard for you to define <code>add_action</code> by hand, just following the example of <code>mul_action</code>.</p>

<p>I'm listening. I've incorporated comments down through Reid Barton's to arrive at the following. But I'm open to reworking it entirely in light of the subsequent comments. Feedback sought on both the current formulation, as well as on the subsequent comments. My overall aim is to develop a formalization in terms of which to express mathematical physics, starting with the classical (Newtonian) case.  </p>

<p>I can work the details of the axioms from here. I guess the remaining pending question is whether this is a good start on an affine space library or whether to revert to a more general theory of torsors with the affine space case as a special case. Or to go with the suggestion by Neil Strickland. The torsor direction is intriguing as our aim is to formalize aspects of physics and metrology, and, indeed, things like time, location, and voltage are torsors. I don't have a strong intuition for how hard it'd be to go in this direction given what's already in the libraries, nor what tradeoffs would be involved in eventually using such a formalization as a target for a physical denotational semantics of programming code (which is where we're headed with this work). Comments/thoughts welcome.</p>

<p>From a math (or a <code>mathlib</code>) perspective it certainly makes sense to define torsors in general and then define affine spaces as torsors over a vector space. But if you're just prototyping for now then there's no need to try to do everything in maximal generality from the start.</p>
