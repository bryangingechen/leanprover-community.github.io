<p>One of the main use cases for abstract math is physics. Suppose I want to do physics formally using Lean. One of the mathematical structures I'd like to work with is that of the real Euclidean space. Can you help me understand how close or far we are from being able to represent real Euclidean spaces in Lean, including objects such as points and vectors, operations such as vector-vector and point-vector addition, and transformations such as rigid body motions and affine transformations more generally? (Beneath this question lies the fact that, for me at least, without many examples, it's hard to know what I can do with the bits and snippets I find out there, e.g., reals as Cauchy sequences, etc.)</p>

<p>right now we are fairly close, but we are still working in some ridiculous generality</p>

<p>we have normed vector spaces, but not much about finite dimensional vector spaces and even less about R^n specifically</p>
