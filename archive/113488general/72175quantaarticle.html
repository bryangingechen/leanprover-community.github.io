<blockquote>
<p>I was reminded of this unexpectedly in 2017 when, in the space of a few days, two logicians, speaking on two continents, alluded to ways of enhancing the proof of FLT — and reported how surprised some of their colleagues were that number theorists showed no interest in their ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder who these "two logicians" are...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But — unlike many who follow number theory at a distance — they were certainly aware that a proof like the one Wiles published is not meant to be treated as a self-contained artifact. On the contrary, Wiles’ proof is the point of departure for an open-ended dialogue that is too elusive and alive to be limited by foundational constraints that are alien to the subject matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>@MichaelHarris</code> can't we have both? Both the self-contained watermark-stamped artifact, and the point of departure for an open-ended dialogue?</p>

<p>Yeah, I have no idea</p>
