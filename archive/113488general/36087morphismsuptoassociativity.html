<p>I wrote a preliminary attempt to allow composing morphisms in a monoidal category that aren't quite composable, and need associators/unitors inserted. Similarly, I want to be able to say two morphisms are equal, up to composing with appropriate associators.</p>

<p>In an attempt to intrigue <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>, I did this in terms of a "canonically_isomorphic" typeclass predicate, so you can write <code>f ≫≅ g</code> to compose two morphisms that aren't quite composable, but are if you have an appropriate <code>canonically_isomorphic</code> instance in between.</p>
<p>Similarly you can write <code>f =≅ g</code> to test equality.</p>

<p>It's definitely just a WIP. In particular, nothing here reflects that fact that a canonical isomorphism from an object to itself <em>must</em> be the identity.</p>

<p>If you admit that both the standard normalisations of class field theory are canonical, which I think they are, then you have to let go of at least one of the following ideas: a composition of canonical isomorphisms is canonical; the inverse of a canonical isomorphism is canonical; the only canonical isomorphism from X to X is the identity.</p>

<p>I'm curious if you've looked at David Roberts' article about Mochizuki's "proof" of abc. It looks very much like he's saying: "Mochizuki is treating canonical isomorphisms as equalities, but he's using too many and they're not actually coherent."</p>
