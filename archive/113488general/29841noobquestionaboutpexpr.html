<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>this may be a stupid question but I was reading about lean's elaborator, and I got confused about the 'pexpr' type.<br>
if I understand correctly, an elaborated term is a term without meta variables.<br>
but then IÂ don't get what the 'pexpr' is, since it's defined as 'expr ff'. so as I read it, this means an unelaborated expression.<br>
but an 'expr' may already contain meta variables, so I don't understand what the 'elaborated' argument really means.</p>
<p>could someone clarify this for me?</p>
