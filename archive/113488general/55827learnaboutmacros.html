<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I've heard about macros in Lean, but I don't exactly know what they are or how they work, except that you can assimilate them with various trust levels. They are not mentioned in the lean tutorial, so what would be a good place to read about them?</p>

<p>To build macros, you really have to work inside Lean itself. It's not really exposed to meta programming</p>

<p>What application do you have in mind?</p>

<p>I wrote a tactic working by reflexivity, inspired from the ring tactic in Coq.<br>
but it's using rationals as constants and can be quite slow.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> mentioned that macros could be used to do the computation more efficiently, running the tactic in the kernel only if that's required, depending on the level of trust.</p>

<p>of course a more direct solution would be to first write a more efficient definition of rat, but he mentioned the macros and I wanted to learn more about them</p>
