<p>In the definition of <code>g</code>, I am forced to mark it as noncomputable, but what does that mean? I thought proofs were programs. Is my definition of <code>g </code>not a program? My proof of g_property uses the axiom of choice according to <code>#print axioms</code> -- and yet it's computable anyway (in the sense that I was not asked to mark it as noncomputable). And I was not asked to mark my definition of <code>lem</code> as computable, but that's a definition which apparently uses the axiom of choice too. What is going on? It all still looks totally random to me but I think I might understand things enough to actually begin to see what this <code>noncomputable</code> thing which I'm randomly asked to put in front of definitions and possibly theorems (does that happen?) actually means, if someone tries to explain it to me...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lean’s standard library defines an additional axiom, propositional extensionality, and a quotient construction which in turn implies the principle of function extensionality. These extensions are used, for example, to develop theories of sets and finite sets. We will see below that using these theorems can block evaluation in Lean’s kernel, so that closed terms of type ℕ no longer evaluate to numerals. But Lean erases types and propositional information when compiling definitions to bytecode for its virtual machine evaluator, and since these axioms only add new propositions, they are compatible with that computational interpretation. Even computationally inclined users may wish to use the classical law of the excluded middle to reason about computation. This also blocks evaluation in the kernel, but it is compatible with compilation to bytecode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from TPIL and it's one of very few parts of the book which I still do not understand. But I don't understand this paragraph at all. I don't know what bytecode is or the virtual machine. I need to be told something easier first.</p>

<p>What I do understand is that there are conjectures I know such as Waring's problem, where there is a number which I regard as "well-defined", but for which no mathematician knows an algorithm for working them out. I can see that these aren't "computable". I guess I don't see why the other things are computable.</p>

<p>It's okay to use choice to make a <code>Sort u</code>, or a proof. If you use it for anything else it's noncomputable.</p>

<p>I think the rules are simply<br>
1. Types and propositions and proofs are always computable (because they are not actually represented at all at runtime). That is, anything whose type is <code>Sort u</code> for some <code>u</code>. This also extends to Pi-types ending in <code>Sort u</code>.<br>
2. Axioms are not computable (because they have no definition). Normally I think this only applies to <code>choice</code> because the other standard axioms are propositions.<br>
3. Anything that uses something noncomputable is noncomputable, except that rule 1 always takes priority.</p>

<p>Maybe I've confused myself and rule 1 is really two separate rules (type erasure and proof irrelevance), not sure.</p>

<p>Ok so perhaps some examples of things which I might want to define are noncomputable <code>nat</code>s and noncomputable functions <code>f : X -&gt; Y</code>. So then my next, and I think my last, question is: what am I losing by having these things marked as noncomputable? Is the only difference that I am basically guaranteed not to be able to prove anything about these noncomputable gadgets using <code>rfl</code>? Is that it? I can just reason about these objects perfectly well using exactly the same sort of reasoning I would use in a maths paper. I would never want to use <code>rfl</code> on these objects anyway because I know they've been defined using some choice function.</p>
<p>With things like the perfectoid project I would work constructively by default, and would just write <code>noncomputable</code> in front of a definition every time Lean told me to. I could instead have just written <code>noncomputable theory</code> at the top of every file. What would I have lost if I'd done that? I am struggling to find any reason at all why I would ever care about computability. Let's say my goal was to define a perfectoid space and then state Scholze's tilting correspondence (this is feasible but would take a fair bit more work), and then let's say my next goal was to prove it (this would take an unfeasibly large amount of work unless I had a big team). Would I ever care about computability ever?</p>

<p><code>noncomputable theory</code> has no downsides except that it makes computability less obvious (which itself may not be a downside depending on your POV). It actually means "please infer <code>noncomputable</code> for me"</p>

<p>As I'm sure you've noticed, lean knows perfectly well which definitions are computable and which aren't, and without <code>noncomputable theory</code> it nags you until you put the markings it knows you should put. <code>noncomputable theory</code>just says to do this automatically without user interaction</p>

<p>Yes. It's the program that returns (x,y), when x is the witness to X being nonempty, and y is the witness to Y being nonempty.</p>

<p>Then you want to give me a function.</p>

<p>Is there a program corresponding to the proof of the theorem that the Riemann Hypothesis is either true or false?</p>

<p>I was thinking about this the other day</p>
