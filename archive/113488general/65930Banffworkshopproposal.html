<p>Dear all, but particularly the mathematicians!

<p>The annual call for proposals at Banff has just come out <a href="https://www.birs.ca/announcements/2019-06-06/2021-Call-for-Proposals" target="_blank" title="https://www.birs.ca/announcements/2019-06-06/2021-Call-for-Proposals">https://www.birs.ca/announcements/2019-06-06/2021-Call-for-Proposals</a></p>
<p>I've successfully organised a number of conferences there in the past, and I wonder if we might try putting something in...</p>

<p>They do a great job of handling all the logistical work, which is great, and they cover accommodation and local expenses for all participants, so it can be a great way to get people together.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's nice to have meetings to get everyone together to talk and work...!</li>
<li>I think it's good to try to push formalisation and interactive theorem proving into visible places, and organising conferences is part of this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe we'd be shut out immediately, but I don't think it's obvious. We would certainly want to invite people from CS (and potentially even other fields, as at Big Proof), but I think if the organisers are primarily mathematicians we could make a strong case that something new and exciting is happening.</p>

<p>Proposing a workshop at BIRS is not a huge amount of work --- from memory you end up writing a 5-10 page document for the proposal, and then if you're accepted, being an organiser is pretty easy.</p>

<p>Sounds like an exciting idea!</p>
