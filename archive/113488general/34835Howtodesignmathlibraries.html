<p>Dear Lean Provers:</p>
<p>A colleague and I have a newly (about to be) funded project involving the mapping of objects of a certain type to physical quantities, represented by terms in the language(s) of mathematical physics formalized in Lean. We'll need libraries that will allow us to represent things like vector, affine, and Euclidean spaces, including objects and transformations, tensors of various kinds, Minkowski spaces, etc. To our knowledge, such libraries don't yet exist.</p>
<p>That leads to the question, what are the best practices for, and what are the most useful resources for informing, the design of mathematical libraries in Lean? Ideally we'd like to have what we produce have a life beyond our lab. I know that numerous of you on this list have been deeply involved in the development of math libraries for the Lean prover. Any informative discussion of what's involved principles, design guidelines, etc. would be much appreciated.</p>
