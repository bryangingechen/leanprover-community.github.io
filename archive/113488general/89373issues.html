<p>I've been trying to clean up the issues list, but it could do with some further love. :-)</p>

<p>I think it would be great if we posted more "ready to start" projects on the issues list, as a central place for newcomers to find things to do. I've added on example as <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1060" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1060">#1060</a>.</p>

<p>I think it would also be good to write some "roadmaps", e.g. towards differential geometry, towards homological algebra, towards schemes, etc.</p>

<p>I think that issues-as-roadmaps will work better than our previous attempts. You can use a big checklist (which has some nice github support) to make the progress more concrete.</p>
