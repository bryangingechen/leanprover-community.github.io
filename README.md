This is a static website, generated by Jekyll, for the [Lean proof assistant](https://leanprover.github.io) community. See the site at <https://leanprover-community.github.io>.

The site includes a static archive of the [leanprover Zulip chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/). This archive is generated by a [script](https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/blob/master/import.py) that builds a local cache of the Zulip chat and updates it periodically.

This script can be easily modified to work for other Zulip chats.

The Jekyll style is thanks to wild-flame:

# jekyll-simple

## simple
simple is a theme designed for blogger using static site generator like jekyll, Hexo etc.

Especially for those who writes in both Chinese and English. The font-type setting looks really good when writers use Chinese mixed with English.

Supposedly, this could work with Japanese as well but never had a chance to try.

## Story behind this theme

It has been long that using font with Chinese in web was a tedious and time-consuming work. It would be almost impossible to make different OS or devices to look the same.

iOS 9 has pulished some new fonts in Chinese and I decided to make one theme that looks good on iOS devices, at the same time, making it acceptable on computers using other fonts.

So mobile goes first, then the macOS.
